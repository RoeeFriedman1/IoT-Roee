Every file is a different Arduino based project, involving using sensors as well as IoT. 
Only the final project me and my partner for these works (Ido Bosmi) did is splitted here to 3 files - CPX1, CPX2, CPX3. A full guidance to this project and a video cacn be found here https://www.instructables.com/IOT/
Inside each code file there is an explanation about the project and the code.
